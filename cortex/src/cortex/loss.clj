(ns cortex.loss
  "Definitions and implementations of cortex loss function terms.  A loss term is a function that takes
a map of arguments and returns a single double number.  The loss function for a network is a weighted summation
across a vector of terms.  The weight on any term is :lambda and is defined with a per-term-default in the loss
metadata for that function type.  The default is 1.

The loss terms can have any number of uniquely named arguments and each argument can bind to one of four
different things.
1.  A node output
2.  A node parameter
3.  A stream
4.  Data tracked by the implementation with an initializer.

The loss term can state which of it's arguments it produces gradients for when asked to produce gradients.
This makes it a little easier for implementations to manage gradients when evaluating loss terms."

  "Get the metadata for a particular loss function.

There are some standard argument definitions:
:output - loss-term contains? :node-id output of the node.
:stream - loss-term contains? :stream the data coming from the data stream.
:parameter - loss-term contains? :node-id :parameter and this is the value of the parameter of the node.

In addition loss functions themselves can have parameters in that the network stores in its
definition in parameter buffers.  This is useful in the case where the loss itself has some running
means associated with it like in the form of center loss.

All losses have a default lambda which weights them against any other elements in the loss.

In general, the loss function for a given network

The map must contain:
{:arguments - The keys and potentially some extra information about the data in the keys passed
to the loss function.

(defn center-loss
  "Center loss is a way of specializing an activation for use as a grouping/sorting
mechanism.  It groups activations by class and develops centers for the activations
over the course of training.  Alpha is a number between 1,0 that stands for the exponential
decay factor of the running centers (essentially running means).  The equation to update a mean
is alpha*current + (1 - alpha)*new-mean.  The network is penalized for the distance of the current
activations from their respective centers.  The result is that the activation itself becomes very
grouped by class and thus make far better candidates for LSH or a distance/sorting system.  Note
that this is a loss used in the middle of the graph, not at the edges.  This is applied to a
given node and needs an softmax-type output stream.
