(ns cortex.nn.execute
  "Executing the graph means training or inference.  The goal is to allow both imperative/effectful implementations
and pure functional implementations but to abstract common details of training or execution into
one place written in such a way that someone can affect the behavior of various implementations and design
new execution strategies (like parameter sharing) at least partially without needing to work withing a specific
implementation.  It is important to realize that training the network means essentially a transformation from
layer-graph -> layer-graph via some training process.
Both train and infer should be wrapped in resource contexts; this is not done at this level.
Furthermore infer should be both wrapped in a resource context and completely realized."
