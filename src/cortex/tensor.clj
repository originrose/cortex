(ns cortex.tensor
  "Tensor library used to implement the basic math abstraction in cortex.  This abstraction is
  meant to provide a language in which to implement new things but that explicitly avoids access
  to certain parts of the comput ecosystem that the engine driving the ecosystem is expected to
  manage.  Clients should not, for instance, access the stream or the datatype directly.

There is an implicit assumption throughout this file that implementations will loop through
  smaller entities instead of throwing an exception if sizes don't match.  This allows for
  instance an efficient accumulation of a batch of gradients into a single summed buffer.

It does mean, however, that certain conditions that would actually be error cases are harder to
  detect because one has to check for remainders being zero (which potentially could cause a
  divide by zero error) instead of just checking for equality.

Assignment has two forms
y = x
y[idx] = x[idx]

For binary operations there are four forms:

y = a*x op b*y
result = a*x op b*y.
y[idx] = a*x[idx] op b*y[idx]
result[idx] = a*x[idx] op b*y[idx]

Op may be: [:+ :* :/].

In the non-indexed cases the element counts of y or x may differ but they need to be
  commensurate meaning that the smaller evenly divides the larger.  When writing to result it is
  important that result is as large as the largest.

For indexed cases we can't enforce really any constraints but if a location in result is written
  to more than once then the outcome is not defined; this is considered a programmatic error
  *!!that cannot be detected at runtime!!* Locations in Y may be written to more than once.

In general we want as much error checking and analysis done in this file as opposed to at the
  implementation level (compute stream level) so that different implementations of this
  duplicate the least number of possible operations and so their edge cases agree to the extent
  possible.


For indirect operations element count is num-indexes * num-columns.  After that they should obey
  the same rules if the element counts of various things do not match meaning the smaller should
  evenly divide the larger and if a separate result is provided it must be the size of the
  larger."

!!!- NVIDIA stores the batch variances in an odd 1/sqrt form.  This probably allows them to
  compute the answer slightly faster but it means the actual meaning of the batch variances
  variable is obscured.  Thus we cannot reliably test the batch-variances variable across
  implementations.  If you want per-batch variances then you need to set the average factor to
  0.0 and then read out the running variances."
