  This system expects a dataset with online data augmentation so that it is
  effectively infinite although the cross-validation and holdout sets do not
  change. By default, the best network is saved to: `trained-network.nippy`

  Note, we have to have enough memory to store the cross-validation dataset
  in memory while training.

  Every epoch a test function is called with these arguments:

  (test-fn context new-network old-network test-ds)

  It must return a map containing at least:
    {:best-network? true if this is the best network
     :network The new network with any extra information needed for comparison assoc'd onto it.}
