# think.cortex.keras

Import of Keras hdf5 models into cortex descriptions.  Requires thinktopic's hdf5 library which you may have to build.

There is a unit test that loads a combined file and ensures it's output is exactly what it should be.

There is also a python script under export that is used from a keras installation with the tensor flow backend in order to create the combined h5 file.
